//Objective-C, a class is itself an object with an opaque type called Class.
//anything inside header is public;
//- before emthod means isntanced method , + means classMethod
//prefix class name with something so that class names will be unique NS and UI are reserved for use by apple
//id means some special kind of object
XYZObject *object = [XYZObject new];
    // is effectively the same as:
    XYZObject *object = [[XYZObject alloc] init];//alloc allocate memroy and clear and init sets to initial properties
Remember even classes are objects of opaque typ called Class.

@synthesize propertyName=instanceVarName; implies the content of property will be stored in instacVar synthesized;by default _propertyName is instance var of propery
